Scripts used to run tests of QMCPACK on various machines
automatically. Users should run ctest directly, as described in the
manual.

These scripts are designed to be called from cron to execute the
various nightly, weekly tests of QMCPACK. They are custom to
particular machines, file systems, and users. 

A *copy* of these scripts should be used for automation. At every
update check for unsafe operations ("rm *") or script actions that can
go awry e.g. if a filesystem is full or unavailable.
